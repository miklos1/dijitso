def jit(signature, jitable, params, generate=None, send=None, receive=None, wait=None):
    """Driver for just in time compilation and import of a shared library with a cache mechanism.

    The signature is used to identity if the library
    has already been compiled and cached. A two-level
    memory and disk cache ensures good performance
    for repeated lookups within a single program as
    well as persistence across program runs.

    If no library has been cached, the passed 'generate'
    function is called with the arguments:

        src = generate(signature, jitable, build_params)

    It is expected to translate the 'jitable' object into
    C or C++(default) source code which will subsequently be
    compiled as a shared library and stored in the disk cache.

    The compiled shared library is then loaded with ctypes and returned.

    For use in a parallel (MPI) context, three functions send, receive,
    and wait can be provided. Each process can take on a different role
    depending on whether generate, or receive, or neither is provided.

      * Every process that gets a generate function is called a 'builder',
        and will generate and compile code as described above on a cache miss.
        If the function send is provided, it will then send the shared library
        binary file as a binary blob by calling send(numpy_array).

      * Every process that gets a receive function is called a 'receiver',
        and will call 'numpy_array = receive()' expecting the binary blob
        with a compiled binary shared library which will subsequently be
        written to file in the local disk cache.

      * The rest of the processes are called 'waiters' and will do nothing.

      * If provided, all processes will call wait() before attempting to
        load the freshly compiled library from disk cache.

    The intention of the above pattern is to be flexible, allowing several
    different strategies for sharing build results. The user of dijitso
    can determine groups of processes that share a disk cache, and assign
    one process per physical disk cache directory to write to that directory,
    avoiding multiple processes writing to the same files.

    This forms the basis for three main strategies:

      * Build on every process.

      * Build on one process per physical cache directory.

      * Build on a single global root node and send a copy of
        the binary to one process per physical cache directory.

    It is highly recommended to avoid have multiple builder processes
    sharing a physical cache directory.
